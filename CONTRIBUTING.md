# Contributing ðŸ¦€

We welcome contributions in the form of adding translations for new examples and
bonus material that Sebastian and co. produce from time to time. You can check
out the [project board](https://github.com/users/nerdai/projects/8) for code
listings, exercises, examples, and bonus materials still left to be translated
into Rust (candle).

In addition to contributing new Rust translations, we do also welcome improvements
to current Rust implementations for all listings, examples and exercises.
